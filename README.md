# VS Code – Formatting Pack

> This repository is a technical presentation and documentation repository.  
> It does not contain downloadable source code or production files.

A **configured working environment** for Visual Studio Code.

This pack provides a clear and consistent framework for formatting, cleanup, and normalization  
of common file types (`.py`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`, `.txt`),  
using VS Code settings and locally executed Python scripts.

The goal is not blind automation,  
but a **controlled set of tools**  
that lets you keep full control over code structure, readability, and consistency,  
regardless of the operating system.

## What’s new in version 1.1

### Three execution modes for scripts

The `clean.py`, `convert.py`, and `space.py` scripts can be executed using **three distinct modes**, via VS Code tasks:  

- **GLOBAL** → processes all supported files in the project  
- **ACTIVE FILE** → applies only to the currently opened file  
- **CUSTOM SELECTION** → allows files to be manually defined in `tasks.json`

These modes provide precise control and reduce the risk of unintended modifications.

### Internal backup system (`backup.py`)

Version 1.1 introduces a local backup system integrated into the workflow:   

- Backup triggered each time a file is saved (**Ctrl + S**)  
  - via the **Auto-Backup** VS Code task  
- No external extension required  
- Timestamped backups stored in `.backups/<file_name>/`  
- Ability to restore a previously saved version in case of error

This system acts as a **standalone alternative to Local History**  
and works entirely offline, across all operating systems.

### Expanded documentation (INSTALL.md, TECHNICAL_README.md)

Version 1.1 includes clearer and more structured documentation:  

- explanation of the three execution modes  
- complete overview of the backup system  
- internal details about script behavior  
- updated compatibility with VS Code 1.90+

---

## Included settings details

### `settings.json`

The provided settings are designed to offer a consistent and predictable working environment,  
without triggering any unwanted automatic formatting.

**Global formatting**  
- `formatOnSave` disabled to avoid conflicts with external formatters (Black, Prettier, etc.)  
- Indentation set to **4 spaces**  
- Line width configured around **100 characters**  
- Encoding set to **UTF-8**  
- Default line endings set to **LF**  
- Settings aimed at minimizing rendering differences across operating systems

**Readability and visual comfort**  
- Line wrapping enabled (`wordWrap: on`) for continuous reading  
- Visualization of significant whitespace (`renderWhitespace: boundary`)  
- Smooth cursor animation and scrolling (`cursorSmoothCaretAnimation`, `smoothScrolling`)  
- Subtle visual guides to avoid unnecessary visual noise

**Interface**  
- Temporary preview file opening disabled  
- Neutral zoom level  
- Integrated terminal configured for comfortable reading (`fontSize: 14`)  
- Keyboard shortcuts limited to simple and explicit action

**Protection and history**  
- Settings compatible with the use of a local backup directory (`.backups`)  
- Local history enabled in Visual Studio Code  
- Automatic exclusion of common technical directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `__pycache__`)

**Errors and visibility**  
- Configuration of the **ErrorLens** extension for direct in-editor error display  
- Intentionally restrained visual style to preserve code readability

---

### Supported languages

The settings are adapted for the following file types:  

**Python**  
- formatting via **autopep8** (4-space indentation), triggered only through the dedicated task

**HTML / CSS / JS**  
- indentation handled by the editor  
- no automatic execution of external formatters

**JSON / JSONC**  
- fixed indentation  
- no automatic formatting to avoid breaking commented JSON files

**Markdown**  
- no automatic formatting  
- content and line breaks preserved

Automatic formatting on save is intentionally disabled  
to maintain full control over applied changes.

---

### Prettier (included configuration)

The provided Prettier settings define a consistent formatting framework,  
without triggering any automatic formatting on save.

- Line width configured around **100 characters**  
- Indentation set to **4 spaces**  
- Single quotes (`'`) enforced for consistency  
- Trailing commas enabled (`trailingComma: es5`)  
- HTML whitespace handling configured (`htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: ignore`)  
- Line endings set to **LF**

These settings are compatible with Prettier,  
but do not imply any automatic execution of the formatter.

---

### Ergonomics and navigation

The interface settings aim to provide smooth and readable navigation,  
without altering the editor’s standard behavior.

- Cursor animation enabled (`cursorSmoothCaretAnimation`)  
- Smooth scrolling (`smoothScrolling`)  
- Active line highlighting (`renderLineHighlight`)  
- Minimap toggle via **Alt + M**  
- Temporary preview file opening disabled

---

### Backup and history

- Auto-save disabled to retain full manual control  
- *Hot Exit* enabled to restore open files after restart  
- Local history configured in Visual Studio Code  
- `.backups/` directory used for backups via the dedicated task  
- UTF-8 encoding and **LF** line endings set by default

---

### Productivity and cleanliness

- No automatic formatting triggered on save (`formatOnSave: false`)  
- Cleanup operations (unnecessary spaces, blank lines, margins)  
are launched manually via VS Code tasks:  
  - **Terminal → Run Task…**  
- On save, VS Code applies only its native rules:  
  - removal of trailing whitespace  
  - insertion of a final newline  
- No `runOnSave` or automatic autopep8 execution is enabled by default  
- Common technical directories are excluded from operations  
(`node_modules`, `.git`, `__pycache__`)  

---

### Included extensions

The pack includes tuned configuration for common extensions:  

- **ErrorLens** — direct in-editor error display  
- **Indent-Rainbow** — visualization of indentation levels  
- **Auto Rename Tag** — automatic synchronization of HTML tags

These extensions remain optional and can be disabled freely.

---

### General optimizations

The settings are designed to maintain a stable and readable environment:  

- Reduced number of active extensions to limit conflicts  
- Intentionally restrained interface, without visual clutter  
- Clear workspace organization (editor, explorer, terminal)  
- Automatic file preview disabled  
- Compatible with VS Code *Settings Sync*  
- Suitable for both individual and collaborative use

Performance and memory usage depend  
on the user’s environment and system configuration.

---

### keybindings.json

- `Alt + M` → toggles the minimap display (side view of the code)  
- `Alt + R` → re-indents the currently active file

*Tip: use* **Ctrl + A** *before* **Alt + R** *to re-indent the entire file.*

---

### tasks.json

Available VS Code tasks (manually executed):  

- Python Formatting + Margin Cleanup  
*(autopep8 + `clean.py`, active file)*  
- Margin Cleanup (`clean.py`)  
- Margin Detection (`space.py` — analysis only)  
- CRLF → LF Conversion (`convert.py`)

---

### launch.json

- Allows manual execution of the **active Python script** in the editor  
- Useful for testing Python files individually

---

## About Python formatting

- The pack never alters Python code **logic**  
- It only affects **formatting** (indentation, spacing, readability)  
- If a file contains structural errors or inconsistent blocks,  
no automated tool can infer the correct intent  
- Manual correction may be required before running tasks  
that use autopep8 or `clean.py`

---

## Python maintenance scripts

Scripts can be executed:  

- either via the provided **VS Code tasks**  
- or manually from a terminal

---

### `clean.py`

- Cleans margins on supported files  
(`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`, `.py`, `.txt`)  
- Removes unnecessary spaces and redundant tabs  
- Limits consecutive blank lines to a maximum of 2

```bash
python clean.py
```


### `convert.py`

- Normalizes CRLF (Windows) line endings to LF (Unix)  
- Writes to a file only when a conversion is actually required

```bash
python convert.py
```


### `space.py`

Analyzes files and detects:  

- multiple spaces  
- tab characters  
- trailing whitespace  
- excessive blank lines (> 2)

No file is modified.

```bash
python space.py
```


---

# Important — Script behavior

Depending on the executed task, the scripts (`clean.py`, `convert.py`, `space.py`) may operate:  

- on all supported files in the project  
- on the currently active file  
- or on a manually defined selection

A backup is created when a file is saved (Ctrl + S),  
via the VS Code **Auto-Backup** task.

Backups are stored in the `.backups/` directory  
as timestamped copies.

Additional details are available in the `INSTALL.md` file.

---

## Security and integrity

All scripts run locally:  
no network connection, no data transfer.

Cleanup and conversion scripts always ignore  
the `.backups/` directory.

The code is readable and editable, with no obfuscation  
and no dependency on external services.

Compatible with isolated environments  
(offline, intranet, secured workstations).
